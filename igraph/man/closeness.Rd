\title{Closeness centrality of vertices}
\usage{
closeness(
  graph,
  vids = V(graph),
  mode = c("out", "in", "all", "total"),
  weights = NULL,
  normalized = FALSE
)

estimate_closeness(
  graph,
  vids = V(graph),
  mode = c("out", "in", "all", "total"),
  cutoff,
  weights = NULL,
  normalized = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The graph to analyze.}

\item{vids}{The vertices for which closeness will be calculated.}

\item{mode}{Character string, defined the types of the paths used for
measuring the distance in directed graphs. \dQuote{in} measures the paths
\emph{to} a vertex, \dQuote{out} measures paths \emph{from} a vertex,
\emph{all} uses undirected paths. This argument is ignored for undirected
graphs.}

\item{weights}{Optional positive weight vector for calculating weighted
closeness. If the graph has a \code{weight} edge attribute, then this is
used by default. Weights are used for calculating weighted shortest
paths, so they are interpreted as distances.}

\item{normalized}{Logical scalar, whether to calculate the normalized
closeness. Normalization is performed by multiplying the raw closeness by
\eqn{n-1}, where \eqn{n} is the number of vertices in the graph.}

\item{cutoff}{The maximum path length to consider when calculating the
betweenness. If zero or negative then there is no such limit.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector with the closeness values of all the vertices in
\code{v}.
}
\description{
Closeness centrality measures how many steps is required to access every other
vertex from a given vertex.
}
\details{
The closeness centrality of a vertex is defined by the inverse of the
average length of the shortest paths to/from all the other vertices in the
graph:

\deqn{\frac{1}{\sum_{i\ne v} d_vi}}{1/sum( d(v,i), i != v)}

If there is no (directed) path between vertex \code{v} and \code{i}, then
the total number of vertices is used in the formula instead of the path
length.

\code{estimate_closeness} only considers paths of length \code{cutoff} or
smaller, this can be run for larger graphs, as the running time is not
quadratic (if \code{cutoff} is small). If \code{cutoff} is zero or negative
then the function calculates the exact closeness scores.

g <- make_ring(10)
