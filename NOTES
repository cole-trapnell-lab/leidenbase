Checklist
  o  update leidenalg source files are required. Check that the leidenalg
     version is compatible with the C igraph version used in rigraph.
  o  update cigraph submodule as required. The cigraph submodule must be
     compatible with the rigraph version.
  o  update rigraph/Makefile-cigraph as required
  o  update rigraph files in leidenbase/src as required
  o  remove the rigraph source files (from src) related to cpp11.cpp/cpp11.h
     These (include) cpp11.cpp, cpprinterface.cpp, igraph_types.hpp,
     igraph_vector.hpp, igraph-win.def, init.cpp.
     This includes removing igraphhcass2 from rinterface_extra.c
  o  remove src/rinterface.c, which exposes the igraph functions to R.
     (These are used by rigraph.)
  o  check that tools/* and src/<rigraph files> are compatible with the
     versions in the rigraph version to be used.
  o  add -Ileidenalg -Ileidenbase to the PKG_CPPFLAGS variable in
     tools/stimulus/Makevars.* files

  o  check that leidenalg and leidenbase function parameter types match
  o  check that leidenbase and rigraph function parameter types match

  o  check for changes in rigraph Makefile-cigraph, and configure.ac
  o  check for updates to rigraph tools/stimulus (e.g., Makevars.*)

  o  check for spurious files in package tar file

  o  run tests consisting of comparisons of R leidenbase and Python leidenalg

  o  run 'R CMD check' and 'R CMD check --as-cran' on the source file.

  o  check that leidenbase installs on supported/CRAN-tested platforms
     using rhub (win-builder too), e.g. R:
       > rhub::check_for_cran(path=<package gzip file>, email=<email address)
  o  push modified dev branch to github
  o  push modified main branch to github

  o  update leidenalg and cigraph versions in DESCRIPTION
  o  update NEWS.md

1. update cigraph git submodule
     o  I believe that the submodule commit should be the same as the commit
        used in the current rigraph package, which may not be the most recent
        cigraph release branch.

     o  update a submodule with the commands
          cd cigraph
          git checkout master
          git pull
          cd ..
          git commit
     o  set cigraph submodule to the required commit version for
        consistency with rigraph.
     o  update leidenbase/patches/ contents
     o  run in leidenbase/  'make -f Makefile-cigraph clean' and 'make -f Makefile-cigraph'
        to update cigraph files in leidenbase. This may not be required.
     o  Makefile-cigraph replaces/updates leidenbase/vendor/, leidenbase/src/core/, and
        leidenbase/src/include/.

2. modify rigraph files
     o  use rigraph commit that's compatible with leidenalg
     o  compare rigraph/Makefile-cigraph to leidenbase/Makefile-cigraph
        notes:
          o  confirm these notes by comparing leidenbase/Makefile-cigraph to
             rigraph/Makefile-cigraph
          o  remove lines related
               o  stimulus and related code
               o  python and virtual environment
               o  rinterface.c related lines
               o  RSRC
          o  add
               o  LEIDENALGSRC := $(shell git ls-files --full-name src/leidenalg)
               o  LEIDENBASESRC := $(shell git ls-files --full-name src/leidenbase) 
          o  edit
               o  OBJECTS
               o  RGEN
               o  pre_build
               o  clean: rm ...
     o  compare rigraph/configure.ac to leidenbase/configure.ac
          o  change AC_CONFIG_SRCDIR(src/rinterface.c) to AC_CONFIG_SRCDIR(src/rinterface_extra.c)
             because I drop rinterface.c.
     o  update as required
           o  tools/stimulus/(Makevars.in|Makevars.ucrt|Makevars.win)
              Need to have paths to leidenalg and leidenbase include files.
     o  remove the function int igraphhcass2() from leidenbase/src/rinterface_extra.c.
        It's unused and is related to stimulus code. (It may be possible to leave it
        if rinterface_extra.c but I'm removing it.)
     o  compare leidenbase/src/(lazyeval.c|rinterface_extra.c|rrandom.c) to the versions
        in rigraph/src and update if differences.
     o  compare leidenbase/vendor/ to rigraph/vendor/ and update as necessary
     o  leidenbase/src/config.h.in is copied from leidenbase/cigraph/src by the
        Makefile-cigraph script so it should get update automatically
     o  update files in leidenbase/src/vendor/ using rigraph/src/vendor/, as
        required.
3. modify leidenalg files
     o  update leidenalg source files to a version compatible with the cigraph
        version that's compatible with rigraph.
     o  note: I had a problem with the windows compiler finding the leidenalg
        include files so I needed to change some '#include <>' to '#include ""'
        It may make sense to put the include files in a separate include directory
        and modify the leidenbase/tools/stimulus/Makevars.* files as required.
     o  potentially edit the files
          ==== MutableVertexPartition.cpp ====
          
          3,4d2
          < #undef DEBUG
          <
          479a478
          >   cerr << "This function is deprecated, use MutableVertexPartition::set_membership(vector<size_t> const& membership)" << endl;
          904a904
          >   vector<bool> comm_added(this->n_communities(), false);
          910c910,914
          <       neigh_comms.push_back(comm);
          ---
          >       if (!comm_added[comm])
          >       {
          >         neigh_comms.push_back(comm);
          >         comm_added[comm];
          >       }
          
          
          ==== Optimiser.cpp ====
          
          41a42,47
          > void Optimiser::print_settings()
          > {
          >   cerr << "Consider communities method:\t" << this->consider_comms << endl;
          >   cerr << "Refine partition:\t" << this->refine_partition << endl;
          > }
          >

        That is, remove the cerr usage (print_settings is unused). And the modifications to
        MutableVertexPartition.cpp at line 910 should be made in future commits to the
        leidenalg repository. That is, the conditional block of statements should have been
        replaced by the single line 'neigh_comms.push_back(comm);'.
     o  do not use any leidenalg *.py files in leidenbase

4. Leidenbase compiles now with the C compiler attribute 'visibility' set to 'hidden'.
   There is some GCC documentation on visibility at
     https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility
   and the R documentation can be found at
     https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Controlling-visibility.
   The compilation visibility is set in the leidenbase/tools/stimulus/Makevars.*
   files. For example,

     PKG_CFLAGS=$(C_VISIBILITY)
     PKG_CXXFLAGS=$(CXX_VISIBILITY)
     PKG_FFLAGS=$(F_VISIBILITY)

   When visibility is set to 'hidden', the '_leiden_find_partition()' cpp functions
   must have visibility set to 'global' so that R can find it for the .Call()
   function in the leidenbase/R/leidenbase.R function. This is done at this time in
   the function

     extern "C" attribute_visible void R_init_leidenbase(DllInfo *info)
     {
        R_registerRoutines(info, NULL, CallMethods, NULL, NULL);
        R_useDynamicSymbols(info, FALSE);
     }

   in the file leidenbase/src/leidenbase/leidenFindPartitionR2C.cpp. The visibility
   of the functions in the leidenbase/src/leidenbase.so object file can be found
   using the Linux utilities 'nm' and 'readelf'.

5. There may be other changes that I've forgotten or need to be made in the future.

6. The script leidenbase/tests/cpp_tests/leidenalg_ref.py is meant to simplify testing
   in which leidenbase output is compared to the corresponding leidenalg python
   interface output. leidenalg_ref.py runs the python leidenalg functions and writes
   a file that can be 'source'ed in R and, using the R function
   'cmp_comms(leidenalg_part)', compares the outputs of leidenalg and leidenbase. The
   function 'make_ref()' can be called multiple times to make multiple output files
   made using different leidenalg partition conditions. This program can be expanded
   and improved in the future.
