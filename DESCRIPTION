Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person( 'Brent', 'Ewing', role = c( 'aut', 'cre' ), email = 'bge@uw.edu' )
Description: An R to C interface that runs the Leiden community
     detection algorithm to find a basic partition. It runs the
     equivalent of the find_partition() function, which is
     given in the Leidenalg distribution file
     'leiden/src/functions.py'. This package includes the
     required source code files from the official Leidenalg
    distribution and several functions from the R igraph
    package.  The Leidenalg distribution is available from
    https://github.com/vtraag/leidenalg
    and the R igraph package is available from
    https://igraph.org/r/.
    The Leiden algorithm is described in the article
    'From Louvain to Leiden: guaranteeing well-connected communities',
