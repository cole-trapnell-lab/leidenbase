             function for memory problems using
             an instrumentation program such as
             valgrind
             and comparing to the leidenalg
             python module output.

             running the leiden executable.

notes:
  o  set up test directory
       o  make a test directory
       o  copy igraph_edgelist.txt.gz,
          leiden.cpp, and Makefile from
          this directory to the test
          directory
       o  gunzip igraph_edgelist.txt.gz
       o  copy leidenFindPartition.cpp
          to the test directory
       o  copy the leidenalg *.cpp and
          *.h files to the test directory
  o  build leiden executable
       o  use the make utility to build
          the executable
  o  run leiden executable
       o  type 'leiden'
  o  test leiden using valgrind
       o  type 'valgrind --leak-check=full leiden'
  o  specifying a directed graph vs an undirected
     graph gives about 1/2 the communities. The
     python py igraph module appears to default
     to reading the edgelist as an undirected
     graph.
